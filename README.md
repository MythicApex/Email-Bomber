make sure to enter the victim's email in the email.txt file. the script will ask you for your own email and password.

if your gmail messages are not sending. maybe it is because you havent enabled less secure apps on gmail. 
to do this you must:

Open your Google my account settings (https://myaccount.google.com/).
Click Security.
Scroll down untill you see "Less secure app access".
Press the "Turn on access" button.
Next, flip the switch from off to on.
You are now done!

everything should be working now. if something goes wrong. please contact my discord mythic#9999
